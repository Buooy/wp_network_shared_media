== In random order ==

- add option to replace "media" tab altogether
- make above option cross-network?!?
- add "featured image" link (or don't remove it and make it work)
  maybe hook to get__thumbnail_id_metadata filter ( /wp-includes/meta.php line 272)
  and add__thumbnail_id_meta action ( /wp-includes/meta.php line 62)
  but many problems ahead...
