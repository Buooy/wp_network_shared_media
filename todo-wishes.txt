http://wordpress.org/support/topic/some-libraries-show-broken-images

== In random order ==

- insert media does not work for "main" blog (blog_id=1) quickpress
- add option to replace "media" tab altogether
- make above option cross-network?!?
- add "featured image" link (or don't remove it and make it work)
  maybe hook to get__thumbnail_id_metadata filter ( /wp-includes/meta.php line 272)
  and add__thumbnail_id_meta action ( /wp-includes/meta.php line 62)
  but many problems ahead...
- make gallery shortcode work with networked images (see gallery_shortcode function)

== featured image support ==
Retrieving begins in wp-includes/post-thumbnail-template.php
1. has_post_thumbnail calls get_post_thumbanail_id()
2. get_post_thumbnail_id returns get_post_meta
   returns get_metadata (post.php)
   calls apply_filters 'get_post_metadata' (meta.php) with $meta_key = _thumbnail_id && $single = true
   So: filter get_post_metadata should return single item on meta_key = '_thumbnail_id'
3. the_post_thumbnail echos get_the_post_thumbnail
4. update_post_thumbnail_cache
5. get_the_post_thumbnail calls get_post_thumbnail_id
   does_actions 'begin_fetch_post_thumbnail_html' and 'end_fetch_post_thumbnail_html'
   returns apply_filters 'post_thumbnail_html'

Setting begins in wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php
1. wp_ajax_set_post_thumbnail
   calls delete_post_thumbnail calls delete_post_meta calls delete_metadata does action delete_post_meta
   or calls set_post_thumbnail and _wp_post_thumbnail_html

Display in admin begins in wp-admin/includes/meta-boxes.php
1. post_thumbnail_meta_box echos _wp_post_thumbnail_html (post.php)
   returns apply_filters admin_post_thumbnail_html
